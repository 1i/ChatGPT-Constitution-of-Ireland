Being bored one evening  and hearing all the rage about ChatGPT,
I wanted to see what could it do.

Idea, provide a history of git commits of the Irish consitutation,
so that I could diff between the changes and that changes suggested but not applied.


A friend of mine working for a government body did explain they used a complicated form of diff software for comparing legal contracts.
